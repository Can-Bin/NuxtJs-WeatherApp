# WeatherApp

I created a Weather Application with NuxtJS which is open source and free JavaScript library.

While working on this project, I utilized from OpenWeatherMap API.

After I completed the frontend design by using html and css, I fetched the data from API with the fetch method and stored these data in an array. Then I manipulated the data as required.

After installing dependencies and node modules, please execute the "npm run dev" command in order to start the project at localhost:3000

When you click the localhost:3000 You will see the user interface and have a chance to search for a city that you want to see its weather forecast.
